# Transport Layer Security inspection (preview) overview
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol uses certificates at the transport layer to ensure the privacy, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between two communicating parties. This article provides an overview of the TLS inspection process and explains how it enhances security by enabling visibility into encrypted traffic. With TLS inspection, Global Secure Access admins can create and manage TLS inspection policies to detect and mitigate threats hidden within encrypted communications.

## The TLS inspection process
TLS secures application-layer protocols like HTTP by encrypting transmitted data. While TLS secures legitimate traffic, malicious traffic like malware and data leakage attacks can still hide behind encryption.

The Microsoft Entra TLS inspection process provides visibility into encrypted traffic by making content available for malware detection, data loss prevention, prompt inspection, and other advanced security controls for enhanced protection.

When you create a TLS inspection policy to inspect traffic, the Global Secure Access service first terminates HTTPS requests at the service edge and then applies security controls. If no security controls block it, Global Secure Access forwards the request to the destination. The process establishes two separate TLS connections:   
- One from the client browser to Global Secure Access.   
- Another from Global Secure Access to the destination server.   

The Global Secure Access service creates an intermediate certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority to generate short-lived leaf certificates. These leaf certificates are used in TLS handshakes between client devices and Global Secure Access. Client devices must have the trusted certificate authority in their trusted certificate store. The browser validates the certificate chain in the browserâ€™s certificate store.

To get started with TLS inspection, see [Configure Transport Layer Security](how-to-transport-layer-security.md). 

## Supported TLS cipher suites
Microsoft Entra TLS inspection enables TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 by default. However, Microsoft Entra doesn't support TLS 1.3 with Encrypted Client Hello (ECH).

TLS supports the following ciphers:
- [ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256|ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305]   
- [ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256|ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305]   
- [ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384]
