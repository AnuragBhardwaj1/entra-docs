    questions:
      - question: What is Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection? 
        answer: TLS inspection decrypts and analyzes encrypted network traffic to detect threats, enforce security policies, and prevent data exfiltration. Given that most internet traffic is encrypted, inspecting internet traffic is crucial for comprehensive security.
          
      - question: How does TLS inspection work? 
        answer: TLS inspection intercepts encrypted network traffic, decrypts it for security analysis, and re-encrypts it before sending it to its destination. To implement this process securely, define a TLS inspection policy, choose a trusted certificate authority for decryption, and deploy a trusted certificate to endpoints. These steps ensure seamless operation and prevent security warnings.   

      - question: What is certificate pinning, and how does it affect TLS inspection? 
        answer: Certificate pinning restricts an application's TLS connections to specific certificates. This restriction prevents interception but also blocks security solutions that rely on TLS inspection.   

      - question: How should we handle applications that use certificate pinning? 
        answer: The connection fails if MitM TLS inspection terminates traffic from applications that use certificate pinning. To ensure your applications work as expected, create a custom bypass rule in the traffic forwarding profile to exclude traffic from these applications from Global Secure Access. We're working on TLS bypass to let you acquire traffic and apply security controls that don't rely on TLS inspection.

      - question: Is TLS 1.3 supported? 
        answer: Microsoft Entra supports TLS 1.3 end-to-end, with TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 enabled by default. The highest mutually supported version is selected for the session, from the client to Global Secure Access and from Global Secure Access to the destinations. We don't support TLS 1.3 with Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) because the Server Name Indication (SNI) is encrypted, which prevents Global Secure Access from creating the corresponding leaf certificates for TLS termination.

      - question: What happens if I have legacy applications using less secure TLS versions, such as TLS 1.1?
        answer: We recommend bypassing TLS inspection for these destinations. TLS 1.2 is the minimum recommended version because older versions, like TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.0, are insecure and vulnerable to attacks. Whenever possible, migrate these applications to support TLS 1.2 or higher.

      - question: Do you use hardware security modules (HSM) to protect keys?
        answer: Keys aren't stored using hardware protection. Instead, keys are stored in memory to dynamically generate leaf certificates for websites. While not protected by an HSM, access to our servers is highly restricted, and we implement stringent security controls to safeguard key access and system integrity.

      - question: What other Global Secure Access features have dependencies on TLS inspection?
        answer: Content-based security controls have dependencies on TLS inspection, including URL-enhanced web category, anti-malware, DLP, ATP, and others.
