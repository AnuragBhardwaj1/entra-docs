# Support statement for Global Secure Access for Microsoft Entra China
Microsoft is dedicated to supporting Global Secure Access capabilities in China, providing secure and compliant connectivity solutions that meet the unique needs of organizations operating in China. There are two scenarios that are applicable to Global Secure Access in China.    
1. Global Secure Access availability for customer tenants deployed on Microsoft Entra China. **Microsoft currently doesn’t support this scenario**. 
1. Global Secure Access availability for tenants outside China. This scenario includes use cases where Global Secure Access customers with a presence in multiple geographies make a temporary visit to China. For example, when an employee of USA-based company Contoso, using Global Secure Access, travels to China. **Microsoft supports this scenario**.    

However, it’s important to recognize the specific connectivity disclaimers that apply to Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) providers operating in China. Due to regulatory restrictions and local infrastructure requirements, SASE providers might encounter:    
- **Service Limitations**: Connectivity performance can vary due to internet regulations and restrictions on VPN usage. Additionally, local routing policies can affect network latency and bandwidth. Due to the unpredictable nature of connectivity, user experience might vary. 
- **Regulatory Compliance Constraints**: Adhering to China's legal framework means requiring local licensing or partnerships with in-region service providers to meet compliance requirements. Reliance on in-region networks can affect the service-level agreement (SLA) for connectivity and service. 
- **Restricted Access to Global Resources**: Direct access to international applications and resources might be subject to restrictions, which can affect seamless global connectivity.    

Certain regulatory restrictions are imposed on traffic exiting China. Microsoft doesn't influence the enforcement of any of these restrictions. Our customers are contractually obligated to comply with any such restrictions when using our services and products. Microsoft constantly reviews the dynamic regulatory landscape in China and reserves the right to take any measures necessary to ensure the security of all customers on its cloud, including but not limited to a suspension or shutdown of service. As with any jurisdiction, it's our customers' responsibility to ensure their own compliance with local regulations when using Microsoft services.    

Our commitment to Global Secure Access in China reflects a balanced approach to providing a high standard of secure access, while transparently addressing these limitations, to help customers navigate the complexities of operating in China’s regulated cloud environment. We strive to work closely with our customers to ensure they remain compliant and secure, with solutions tailored to address both global security standards and local regulatory requirements.
