# Using groups managed by Privileged Identity Management with access packages reference

This article contains Microsoft Entra ID behavior in different scenarios if the group managed by PIM and the access package expiration periods differ. By assigning a group managed by PIM to an access package, you're able to assign eligible roles to a group when an access package is requested. If youâ€™re looking for a guide on setting up a group to assign eligible roles via access packages, see: [Assign eligible group membership and ownership in access packages via Privileged Identity Management for Groups (Preview)](entitlement-management-access-package-eligible.md).


## Entitlement Management

> [!Tip]
> We recommend that access packages contain more than one resource role and are modeled on the basis of departments, job functions, locations, projects or a combination of these.

|Feature  |Limit  |
|---------|---------|
|Access Packages   |  20,000 per tenant      |

## Lifecycle Workflows
