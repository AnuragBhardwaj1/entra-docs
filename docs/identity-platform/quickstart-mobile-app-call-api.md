Before you begin, use the **Choose a tenant type** selector at the top of this page to select tenant type. Microsoft Entra ID provides two tenant configurations, [workforce](../external-id/tenant-configurations.md) and [external](../external-id/tenant-configurations.md). A workforce tenant configuration is for your employees, internal apps, and other organizational resources. An external tenant is for your customer-facing apps.
