#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to configure a sample mobile app so that I can sign in my employees or customers by using Microsoft identity platform.

# Quickstart: Sign in users in a sample mobile app

Before you begin, use the **Choose a tenant type** selector at the top of this page to select tenant type. Microsoft Entra ID provides two tenant configurations, [workforce](../external-id/tenant-configurations.md) and [external](../external-id/tenant-configurations.md). A workforce tenant configuration is for your employees, internal apps, and other organizational resources. An external tenant is for your customer-facing apps.

#### [Android](#tab/android-workforce)

In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how an Android application can sign in users and get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API.

Applications must be represented by an app object in Microsoft Entra ID so that the Microsoft identity platform can provide tokens to your application.

#### [iOS/macOS](#tab/ios-macos-workforce)

In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how a native iOS or macOS application can sign in users and get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API.

The quickstart applies to both iOS and macOS apps. Some steps are needed only for iOS apps and will be indicated as such.

## How the sample works

#### [Android](#tab/android-workforce)

![Diagram showing how the sample app generated by this quickstart works.](media/quickstart-v2-android/android-intro.svg)

The code is organized into fragments that show how to write a single and multiple accounts MSAL app. The code files are organized as follows:

| File                                    | Demonstrates                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MainActivity                            | Manages the UI                                                                                                   |
| MSGraphRequestWrapper                   | Calls the Microsoft Graph API using the token provided by MSAL                                                   |
| MultipleAccountModeFragment             | Initializes a multi-account application, loads a user account, and gets a token to call the Microsoft Graph API  |
| SingleAccountModeFragment               | Initializes a single-account application, loads a user account, and gets a token to call the Microsoft Graph API |
| res/auth_config_multiple_account.json   | The multiple account configuration file                                                                          |
| res/auth_config_single_account.json     | The single account configuration file                                                                            |
| Gradle Scripts/build.grade (Module:app) | The MSAL library dependencies are added here                                                                     |

We'll now look at these files in more detail and call out the MSAL-specific code in each.

#### [Android](#tab/android-external)

This guide demonstrates how to configure a sample Android mobile application to sign in users.
  
In this article, you do the following tasks: 
 
- Register an application in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
- Add a platform redirect URL.
- Enable public client flows.   
- Update the Android configuration code sample file to use your own Microsoft Entra External ID for customer tenant details.  
- Run and test the sample Android mobile application.

#### [Android(.NETMAUI)](#tab/android-netmaui-external)

This how-to guide uses a sample .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) to show how to add authentication to an Android application by using an external tenant. The sample application enables users to sign in and sign out. The sample .NET MAUI Android application uses [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) for .NET to handle authentication.

In this article, you do the following tasks:

- Register a .NET MAUI Android application in the external tenant.
- Create a sign-in and sign-out user flow in the external tenant.
- Associate your .NET MAUI Android application with the user flow.
- Update a sample .NET MAUI Android application to use your own external tenant details.
- Run and test the sample .NET MAUI Android application.


#### [iOS/macOS](#tab/ios-macos-external)

This guide demonstrates how to configure a sample iOS mobile application to sign in users.

In this article, you do the following tasks: 

- Register an application in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
- Add a platform redirect URL.
- Enable public client flows.   
- Update the iOS configuration code sample file to use your own Microsoft Entra External ID for external tenant details.  
- Run and test the sample iOS mobile application.
