# How to enable the QR code authentication method in Microsoft Entra ID (Preview)

This topic covers how to enable the QR code authentication method in the Authentication methods policy in Microsoft Entra ID. It also covers how to manage QR code authentication method for users, and how they can sign in with a QR code and PIN. 

## Prerequisites to enable the QR code authentication method

- Microsoft Entra ID tenant with at least an F1, F3 or P1 license. 
- Android, iOS or iPadOS (iOS/iPadOS version 15.0 or later) shared devices. 
- Shared device mode enabled on the shared devices (optional but highly recommended). 
- A printer to print 2" x 2" QR codes. 
- Teams app installed on the shared device (Android version 1.0.0.2024143204 or later and iOS version 1.0.0.77.2024132501 or later)
- [Enable and setup MyStaff portal](~/identity/role-based-access-control/my-staff-configure.md#how-to-enable-my-staff) if you plan for frontline managers to use MyStaff to provision, manage, and reset QR code and PINs. 

## Enable QR code authentication method

You can enable the QR code authentication method by using the Microsoft Entra admin center or Microsoft Graph API. 

### Enable QR code authentication method in the Microsoft Entra admin center

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Go to **Protection** > **Authentication methods** > **Policies**.
1. Click **QR code** > **Enable and target** > **Add target** > select a group of users who need to sign in with a QR code. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/enable-qr-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable QR code for an organization.":::

1. Update default QR code settings as needed:
   - By default, the PIN length is 8 digits. The PIN length can be 8 to 20 digits. If you increase the PIN length, the new value becomes the minimum number of digits required for the PIN. For example, if you increase the PIN length to 10, a user needs to create a PIN with at least 10 digits when they are forced to change their PIN.
   - The default lifetime of a standard QR code (provided to the users for long term use) is 365 days. The range is between 1-395 days.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/concept-authentication-qr-code/qr-code-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to updates QR code settings.":::

1. When you are done, click **Save**.

## Add QR code authentication method for a user

You can add a QR code authentication method for a user by using the Microsoft Entra admin center, My Staff, or Microsoft Graph API. 

### Add QR code authentication method for a user in the Microsoft Entra admin center

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-administrator).

1. Go to **Users**, select a user, and click **Authentication methods**.

1. Click **Add authentication method** and choose **QR code**.
